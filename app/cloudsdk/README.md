# Particle Android Cloud SDK

## Introduction

The Particle Android Cloud SDK enables Android apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud. As an easy-to-use wrapper for the Particle REST API, the Cloud SDK can:

- Get a list of Particle devices claimed by a user account
- Read variables from devices
- Invoke functions on devices
- Publish events from your mobile app and subscribe to events coming from devices
- Get data usage information for cellular devices
- Claim/unclaim devices for a user account
- Manage & inject user sessions for the Particle Cloud (access tokens, encrypted session management)


## Getting started, getting help, and everything else
