**Overview**<br>
Weighstable is a smart trash can with an Android companion app. Ultrasonic and weight sensors attached to the trash<br>
can read how full the trash can is and how much it weighs at 5 sec intervals. The data is then sent to the companion<br>
app were it is easily visible on the home screen.

**Key Features**<br>
* User login and registration using Firestore database and authentication
* Configurable limits for trash can weight and capacity with occumpanying notifications
* Option to create a "Household" with multiple people for a rotating schedule of whose turn it is to take out the trash
* Log of who and when the trash is taken out along with the weight (backed up with Firestore database)
* Integration with Google calendar to create a "Trash Day" if using waste services (i.e. scheduled trash pickup)
